# World-University-Rankings-Analysis

World University Rankings Analysis
Objective
Analyze the World University Rankings to uncover insights into the factors that impact global university rankings, using SQL to perform data exploration and analysis.

Project Steps:
1. Database Setup
Import the dataset into your SQL environment.
Set up the table with appropriate columns (Rank, University, Country, Teaching, Research, etc.).

2. Data Exploration Using SQL
Explore the structure of the dataset using basic SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, COUNT(), GROUP BY, etc.).

3. Analysis Questions

i. Top Universities by Overall Score
ii. Top Countries by Research Performance
iii. Impact of International Outlook on Rankings
iv. Correlation Between Industry Income and Rankings

4. Conclusion
Summarize the key insights and trends found from your SQL analysis.


5. Conclusion and Insights:
From the SQL queries, we can derive the following insights

•	Top Universities:
The top 10 universities by overall score typically belong to countries with strong research and teaching performances.

•	Research Performance:
Countries such as the US and the UK tend to dominate research performance metrics, correlating with their high university rankings.

•	International Outlook Influence:
A high international outlook score generally correlates with better university rankings, though some universities may rank highly with moderate outlook scores due to strong research or teaching metrics.

•	Industry Income
High industry income can be found among top universities, but it is not always a decisive factor in overall ranking compared to research and citations.
